<h1>Marginalia for Moodle Installation</h1>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release, you will need to update your database
manually.  See instructions below for the specific release from which you are upgrading.</p>

<h2>Fresh Installation</h2>

<p>The installation requires the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>PHP 4.3 or later</li>
	<li>Moodle 1.8 (other versions of Moodle might require a bit of tweaking;  
	the patch utility in step #2 below will let you know)</li>
	<li>MySQL 4.1 or later (though a colleague has had success with MySQL 3; 
	I haven't tested with earlier versions or with Postgres)</li>
	<li>The moodle-lib and moodle-php libraries available on the 
	<a href="http://www.geof.net/code/annotation">Marginalia
	web site</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Install Moodle <em>before</em> installing Marginalia.  If you patch Moodle before
running the Moodle installer, your Moodle istall may not run correctly.</p>

<p>There are two components to the installation:  patching the Moodle code and adding
(or in the case of a Marginalia upgrade) updating the database.  Note that these 
instructions are UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X only.  There are no instructions for installing on 
Windows.</p>

<p>I recommend making a backup of your entire Moodle directory tree before performing
the install.</p>


<h3>1. Patch Moodle</h3>

<p>The moodle.patch file will update existing files in your moodle installation, and
add the Marginalia libraries.  To patch the files, <code>cd</code> to your 
<kbd>moodle</kbd> directory (or whatever it's called on your installation), copy in
<kbd>moodle.patch</kbd> and run the following command:</p>

<pre>
<code>
patch -b -p 1 &lt;moodle.patch
</code>
</pre>

<p>The digit after the <code>-p</code> is the number, not the letter L.  The 
<code>-b</code> option is not strictly necessary, but it allows you to run the
uninstall script.</p>

<p>You should not see any errors.  However, the official release of Moodle is constantly
changing, so there is a possibility that this patch will not match your Moodle version.
In this case, you may need to modify the source files by hand.</p>

<p>Also, this command does not work with the version of patch provided with Solaris
(and possibly with other Unix variants).  If you're on Solaris, you can download the GNU 
patch utility.</p>

<h3>2. Install Marginalia Support Libraries</h3>

<p>In addition to patching Moodle, you will need to add the Marginalia client- and 
server-side libraries, plus Moodle-specfic support code.  These have been separated out
from the Moodle patches in order to make Marginalia upgrades easier.  Copy the contents
of the supplied <kbd>moodle</kbd> directory under the root of your Moodle installation.  You should 
end up with a file structure like this (I have listed only one or two sample directories 
or files in each location so that you can confirm the layout is correct on your system;
your moodle directory may be named differently):</p>

<pre>
moodle/
  annotation/
    annotate.php
    ...
    marginalia/
      annotation.js
      ...
    marginalia-php/
      Annotation.php
      ...
  course/
  ...
  lang/
    en_utf8/
      annotation.php
      ...
      help/
        forum/
  	      annotate.html
          ...
        ...
      ...
    ...
  ...
</pre>
 
  
<h3>3. Update the Database</h3>

<p>You will need to create the annotation table in your Moodle database.  The
<kbd>create-db.php</kbd> script can do this for you if you're using MySQL and if you do
not already have annotation data from an older version of Marginalia for Moodle.  If you
do, please check the upgrade instructions below.  If you are using a database other than
MySQL (something I haven't tried so it may not work), you will need to create the table by
hand.</p>

<p>To use <kbd>create-db.php</kbd>, copy it from the <kbd>util</kbd> directory 
into <kbd>moodle/annotation</kbd>
(again, your Moodle directory may be different on your web server).  Then reference it
with the URL <kbd>http://hostname/moodle/annotation/create-db.php</kbd> (where
<kbd>http://hostname/moodle/</kbd> is the URL of your moodle installation).  This should
report success;  you should then remove the file from the <kbd>annotation</kbd> directory.
(The reason I am not including this there by default is to emphasize that it should be
removed once it has been used.)</p>

<p>If you don't want to use <kbd>create-db.php</kbd>, you can run the commands in
<kbd>util/tables.sql</kbd>.  In this case, you may need to change the name of the
table to from <kbd>mdl_annotation</kbd> to conform to your Moodle configuration.</p>


<h3>4. Modify Marginalia Security Settings</h3>

<h4>ANNOTATION_REQUIRE_USER</h4>

<p>This setting can be changed in <kbd>moodle/annotation/AnnotationGlobals.php</kbd>.</p>

<p>In the default configuration of Marginalia, public annotations are public to 
<em>everyone</em> - even non-course members and non-users of Moodle - via the Atom feed.
If someone wants to read your public annotations, can reach your server, and know the
the correct URL, they can.  This includes the ability to read the highlighted text
associated with an annotation.  If you wish to prevent this, set 
<code>ANNOTATION_REQUIRE_USER</code> to <code>true</code>.  This will also disable
the Atom feed.</p>


<h3>5. Test Marginalia</h3>

<p>You should now be able to connect to your Moodle web server as usual.  You should see
an annotation margin if you visit a forum with posts while logged in.  Select some text 
and click in the long vertical button in the right margin to create annotations.  Now
reload the page:  your annotations should still be there.</p>


<h2>Upgrading from Previous Marginalia Releases</h2>

<p>In most cases, you can upgrade by simply replacing the 
<code>annotation</code> directory in your Moodle installation with the version included
in the new release of Marginalia for Moodle.  To determine whether this will work for
you, check whether your existing installation is older than any of the following dates
(in newer releases of Marginalia you can discover the date of the existing installation
by checking the version.txt file in the annotation directory).  Note that if you are 
upgrading from an older version you may need to perform more than one of these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2007-11-05</strong>: If your existing version is older than this, you will also need to update
files outside the <code>annotation</code> directory (e.g. in <code>lang</code>).  In 
addition, you should check the settings in <code>annotation/config.php</code>.</li>
<li><strong>2007-10-16</strong>: This version introduced per-user tags.  If you use
this feature, you will need to create the <code>mdl_annotation_keywords</code> table
in the database.</li>
<li><strong>2007-08-16</strong>: If your existing version is older than this, you will need to reapply
<code>moodle.patch</code>.  You must apply this patch to fresh a fresh copy of the Moodle
files - not one that has been previously patched for Marginalia.</li>
<li><strong>2007-08-06</strong>:  If your existing version is older than this, you must update the
<code>mdl_annotation</code> table in the database.  See instructions below.</li>
<li><strong>2006-01-07</strong>:  If your existing version is older than this, you must update the
<code>mdl_annotation</code> table in the database.  See instructions below.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is conceivable that I will forget to update this list on occasion.  If you run
into trouble when simply relpacing the <code>annotation</code> directory, it's worth 
contacting me or trying a more thorough reinstall.  I expect it will always be safe
to simply replace the <code>annotation</code> directory even if more updates are
required, but as always I recommend
making back-ups of your Moodle directory and database just to be safe.</p>

<h3>Upgrading to Release 2006-01-07</h3>

<p>If you are updating from a release of Marginalia (annotation for Moodle)
prior to the 2006-01-07 release, you will need to update your database.  Two
columns have since been added to the database schema:
<code>object_id int</code> and <code>object_type varchar(16)</code>.  These make the
queries faster and simpler.  The following SQL code will add the columns and set
their contents correctly (you may need to change the table name from 
mdl_annotation):</p>

<pre>
<code>
alter table mdl_annotation add column object_id int null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column object_type varchar(16) null;
update mdl_annotation set object_type='post';
update mdl_annotation set object_id=substring(url,locate('p=',url)+2);
</code>
</pre>


<h3>Upgrading to Release 2007-08-06</h3>

<p>If you are updating from a release of Marginalia (annotation for Moodle)
prior to the 2007-08-06 release, you will need to update your database.  Several
columns have been added to the database in order to support new features and
increase performance.  The following SQL code will add the columns and set
their contents correctly (you may need to change the table name from 
mdl_annotation):</p>

<pre>
<code>
alter table mdl_annotation add constraint range null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column start_block varchar(255) not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column start_xpath varchar(255) not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column start_word int not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column start_char int not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column end_block varchar(255) not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column end_xpath varchar(255) not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column end_word int not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column end_char int not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column action varchar(30) null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column link varchar(255) null;
alter table_mdl_annotation add column link_title vachar(255) null;
</code>
</pre>


<h2>Installation Problems</h2>

<p>If you have problems (e.g. you can create annotations but they disappear when you
reload the page), it is probably because of a misconfiguration.  First, make sure
that the URL through which you are accessing the application matches the one in
<kbd>config.php</kbd>.  If you are using a different url (e.g. <kbd>localhost</kbd>
instead of a numerical IP address), annotation will not work.</p>

<p>If your URL matches your configuration, I recommend installing and running the Firebug
extension for Firefox.  Among other things, it tracks AJAX requests from a web page to
the server.  The first thing to look for (other than any explicit errors reported by
Firebug) is the URL of the GET request sent to annotation/annotate.php with the parameter
"format=atom" when a page with annotations is first loaded.  Trying loading this URL
on its own in a browser window:  it should return an Atom feed containing the annotations
for that page.</p>

<p>If there
is a problem connecting to the service, you will see an error.  A 404 error indicates
that Apache could not find the annotation service because of a misconfiguration.  One
possible cause is problems with mod_rewrite (see step 4 above).  Any
other error code usually means that the service is available, but something else is
wrong.  If there is a bug in the application, that could show up as an error code other 
than 404.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>This version has not yet been tested and tweaked for Internet Explorer.  It may
work - or it may not.  IE fixes should be forthcoming soon.  Note that Marginalia will
always run a little better on Firefox (e.g. there are user interface niceties on
Firefox that are absent on IE).</li>
<li>Preferences and keywords (tags, if enabled) are to cross-site request forgery.  
Annotation operations, however, are protected.  I simply haven't implemented protection
for the other features yet.  I believe the risk is vanishingly small and the consequences
of any attack would not amount to more than a minor annoyance (having your keywords or
preferences changed, but not even allowing a third party to access your data).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Uninstalling Annotation</h2>

<p>There is currently no automatic mechanism for uninstalling Marginalia, though it
is certainly possible to do so by replacing the patched files with the <kbd>.orig</kbd>
versions and deleting added files.  Previous releases did have an install script, but
I don't want to release it again unless it is guaranteed to be safe for changed versions
of Marginalia.</p>
