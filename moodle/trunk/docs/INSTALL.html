<h1>Marginalia for Moodle Installation</h1>

<p>If you are upgrading from a release earlier than December 2008, you will need
to update your database manually.  See instructions below for the specific 
release from which you are upgrading <strong>before</strong> taking any other 
steps, or you may mangle your data. You can tell that you have an old release 
because the install directory is <kbd>moodle/annotation</kbd> rather than 
<kbd>moodle/local/annotation</kbd>.</p>

<h2>Fresh Installation</h2>

<p>The installation requires the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>PHP 5 or later (might still work on PHP 4.3 or later)</li>
	<li>Moodle 1.8 or 1.9 (other versions of Moodle might require a bit of tweaking;  
	the patch utility in step #2 below will let you know)</li>
	<li>MySQL 4.1 or later (though a colleague has had success with MySQL 3; 
	I haven't tested with earlier versions and I understand Postgres doesn't work)</li>
</ul>

<p>Install Moodle <em>before</em> installing Marginalia.  If you patch Moodle before
running the Moodle installer, your Moodle istall may not run correctly.</p>

<p>There are two components to the installation:  patching the Moodle code and adding
(or in the case of a Marginalia upgrade) updating the database.  Note that these 
instructions are UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X only.  There are no instructions for installing on 
Windows.</p>

<p>I recommend making a backup of your entire Moodle directory tree before performing
the install.</p>


<h3>1. Patch Moodle</h3>

<p>The patch file will update existing files in your moodle installation.  There
are two versions of the patch:  one for Moodle 1.8, another for Moodle 1.9. They
are named moodle18.patch and moodle19.patch respectively.  To apply the patch to
a Moodle 1.9 installation, <code>cd</code> to your <kbd>moodle</kbd> directory 
(or whatever it's called on your installation), copy in <kbd>moodle.patch</kbd> 
and run the following command:</p>

<pre>
<code>
patch -b -p 1 &lt;moodle19.patch
</code>
</pre>

<p>The digit after the <code>-p</code> is the number, not the letter L.  The 
<code>-b</code> option is not strictly necessary, but it allows you to run the
uninstall script.</p>

<p>You should not see any errors.  However, the official release of Moodle is constantly
changing, so there is a possibility that this patch will not match your Moodle version.
In this case, you may need to modify the source files by hand.</p>

<p>Also, this command does not work with the version of patch provided with Solaris
(and possibly with other Unix variants).  If you're on Solaris, you can download the GNU 
patch utility.</p>


<h3>2. Install Marginalia Support Libraries</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is quite unlikely this will apply to you, but
Marginalia uses the Moodle <code>local</code> directory.
Some rare Moodle installations will already have code here which must not be
deleted.  In particular, if <code>db/install.xml</code> already exists, you will
not want to replace your existing file with the one provided here.  In that case,
I suggest creating the database table manually.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have an existing Marginalia installation and
you have changed the settings in <code>annotation/config.php</code>, you will want
to make the same changes in the new <code>config.php</code> file.</p>

<p>In addition to patching Moodle, you will need to add the Marginalia client- and 
server-side libraries, plus Moodle-specfic support code.  These have been separated out
from the Moodle patches in order to make Marginalia upgrades easier.  Copy the contents
of the supplied <code>moodle</code> directory under the root of your Moodle installation.  You should 
end up with a file structure like this (I have listed only one or two sample directories 
or files in each location so that you can confirm the layout is correct on your system;
your moodle directory may be named differently):</p>

<pre>
moodle/
  local/
    annotation/
      annotate.php
      ...
      marginalia/
        annotation.js
        ...
      marginalia-php/
        Annotation.php
        ...
    db/
      install.xml
    lang/
      en_utf8/
        annotation.php
        help/
          annotate.html
  mod/
    forum/
      permalink.php
  ...
</pre>

<p>Make sure mod/forum/permalink.php is installed;  otherwise, links from the
summary page back to individual forum posts may not work.</p>
 
  
<h3>3. Update the Database</h3>

<p>You will need to create the annotation table in your Moodle database.  Moodle
has a mechanism for doing this automatically.  All you need to do is log in to
Moodle as an administrator and click on the <kbd>Notifications</kbd> link in
the <kbd>Site Administration</kbd> sidebar.  That should update the database
correctly.  If there is a problem follow the "Manual Database Update" instructions
below.</p>

<h4>3.1 Manual Database Update</h4>

<p>You may need to update the database manually.  There are two possible reasons
for this:  1) you already have a Marginalia installation from before December 2008,
or 2) the automatic update failed for some reason.</p>

<p>The second case is the simplest.  Simply execute the table creation commands
in <code>util/tables.sql</code>.  You may need to change the name of the
table to from <code>mdl_annotation</code> to conform to your Moodle configuration.</p>

<p>If you already have an old Moodle database, you will need to update it to
match the new specification.  See the "Updating from Previous Marginalia
Releases" section below.</p>


<h3>4. Modify Marginalia Security Settings</h3>

<p>There are a number of configuration settings in <code>moodle/local/annotation/config.php</code>.
Most likely you won't want to change them, but they may be worth looking at.  In
particular, the following could have security implications.</p>

<h4>ANNOTATION_REQUIRE_USER</h4>

<p>In the default configuration of Marginalia, public annotations are public to 
<em>everyone</em> - even non-course members and non-users of Moodle - via the Atom feed.
If someone wants to read your public annotations, can reach your server, and know the
the correct URL, they can.  This includes the ability to read the highlighted text
associated with an annotation.  If you wish to prevent this, set 
<code>ANNOTATION_REQUIRE_USER</code> to <code>true</code>.  This will also disable
the Atom feed.</p>

<h4>AN_ADMINVIEWALL</h4>

<p>This makes it possible through a special Atom feed for administrator to view
everyone's annotations, even if their visibility has been set to private.  This
does <em>not</em> mean administrators will see other users' private annotations
in the margin or on the summary page or anywhere else within Moodle.  It
<em>does</em> mean that if they fetch a special Atom feed they can get the data
for all annotations by everyone.  This feature can be useful for backup
purposes, or to retrieve annotations for research without resorting to direct
queries to the database.  The Atom feed is XML, so an administrator would have
to deliberately go looking for private data:  this would never happen
accidentally.  If you don't want to allow this, set this option to
false.</p>

<h4>AN_ADMINUPDATE</h4>

<p>As of December 2008, all previously-created annotations are absolute.
Marginalia can automatically update old annotations, but it can only do this
when the owning user visits a page displaying those annotations.  When old
annotations are mixed with new ones, margin notes can be displayed in the
wrong order and in the wrong locations, not next to their associated highlights.
This should only be an issue if users use the ability to view annotations by
multiple users simultaneously, but in that case it could be a real problem.
This would not happen if users could update each others' annotations, but that
is not permitted as it could also allow malicious users to damage the annotations
of others.  This setting provides a compromise:  it allows administrators to
update annotations of other users.  To fix the margin on a problem page, all
the administrator needs to do is visit the page, view all the annotations, and
they should all be fixed.  If you don't need this feature (e.g. because you have
a new Marginalia installation) or you are paranoid about security (an
occupational hazard), you can switch it off for a marginal theoretical
increase to security.  However, even when switched on this does not allow
administrators to do anything more than break highlights - viewing private data
or modifying margin notes isn't possible.</p>

<h4>AN_USEKEYWORDS</h4>

<p>When a user types a margin note Marginalia, may try to autocomplete it to
match any existing notes the user has used more than once.  This flag can be
used to switch that behavior off.</p>

<h4>AN_USESMARTQUOTE</h4>

<p>The quoting feature, visible as a <kbd>Quote</kbd> link at the bottom of
each message, and as quotation marks next to annotations, allows users to easily
inject text from forum posts and annotations into posts they write.  This
setting can switch that off (e.g. if smartquoting goes berserk, which I suppose
is possible as it's a new feature).</p>


<h3>5. Test Marginalia</h3>

<p>You should now be able to connect to your Moodle web server as usual.  You should see
an annotation margin if you visit a forum with posts while logged in.  Select some text 
and click in the long vertical button in the right margin to create annotations.  Now
reload the page:  your annotations should still be there.</p>


<h2>Upgrading from Previous Marginalia Releases</h2>

<p>In most cases, you can upgrade by simply replacing the 
<code>local/annotation</code> directory in your Moodle installation with the version included
in the new release of Marginalia for Moodle.  To determine whether this will work for
you, check whether your existing installation is older than any of the following dates
(in newer releases of Marginalia you can discover the date of the existing installation
by checking the <code>version.php</code> file in the <code>local/annotation</code> 
directory).  Note that if you are upgrading from an older version you may need to 
perform more than one of these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>20080-12</strong>:  The file structure has changed.  You no longer need
to add anything under <kbd>moodle/lang</kbd>.  The database structure has changed,
however, and you will need to update the database, as described below.</li>
<li><strong>2007-11-05</strong>: If your existing version is older than this, you will also need to update
files outside the <code>annotation</code> directory (e.g. in <code>lang</code>).  In 
addition, you should check the settings in <code>annotation/config.php</code>.</li>
<li><strong>2007-10-16</strong>: This version introduced per-user tags.  If you use
this feature, you will need to create the <code>mdl_annotation_keywords</code> table
in the database.</li>
<li><strong>2007-08-16</strong>: If your existing version is older than this, you will need to reapply
<code>moodle.patch</code>.  You must apply this patch to fresh a fresh copy of the Moodle
files - not one that has been previously patched for Marginalia.</li>
<li><strong>2007-08-06</strong>:  If your existing version is older than this, you must update the
<code>mdl_annotation</code> table in the database.  See instructions below.</li>
<li><strong>2006-01-07</strong>:  If your existing version is older than this, you must update the
<code>mdl_annotation</code> table in the database.  See instructions below.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is conceivable that I will forget to update this list on occasion.  If you run
into trouble when simply relpacing the <code>annotation</code> directory, it's worth 
contacting me or trying a more thorough reinstall.  I expect it will always be safe
to simply replace the <code>annotation</code> directory even if more updates are
required, but as always I recommend
making back-ups of your Moodle directory and database just to be safe.</p>

<h3>Upgrading to Release 2006-01-07</h3>

<p>If you are updating from a release of Marginalia (annotation for Moodle)
prior to the 2006-01-07 release, you will need to update your database.  Two
columns have since been added to the database schema:
<code>object_id int</code> and <code>object_type varchar(16)</code>.  These make the
queries faster and simpler.  The following SQL code will add the columns and set
their contents correctly (you may need to change the table name from 
mdl_annotation):</p>

<pre>
<code>
alter table mdl_annotation add column object_id int null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column object_type varchar(16) null;
update mdl_annotation set object_type='post';
update mdl_annotation set object_id=substring(url,locate('p=',url)+2);
</code>
</pre>


<h3>Upgrading to Release 2007-08-06</h3>

<p>If you are updating from a release of Marginalia (annotation for Moodle)
prior to the 2007-08-06 release, you will need to update your database.  Several
columns have been added to the database in order to support new features and
increase performance.  The following SQL code will add the columns and set
their contents correctly (you may need to change the table name from 
mdl_annotation):</p>

<pre>
<code>
alter table mdl_annotation add constraint range null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column start_block varchar(255) not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column start_xpath varchar(255) not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column start_word int not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column start_char int not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column end_block varchar(255) not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column end_xpath varchar(255) not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column end_word int not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column end_char int not null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column action varchar(30) null;
alter table mdl_annotation add column link varchar(255) null;
alter table_mdl_annotation add column link_title vachar(255) null;
</code>
</pre>


<h3>Upgrading to Release 2008-12-xx</h3>
<p>As of December 2008, the <code>start_line</code>
and <code>end_line</code> columns are new.  You can add them in MySQL with the
following command (remember to use the appropriate table prefix for your
Moodle installation):</p>

<pre>
<code>
    alter table mdl_annotation add column start_line int not null;
	alter table mdl_annotation add column end_line int not null;
</code>
</pre>

<p>In future, Marginalia will aim to use Moodle's built-in database update
facility.  But if you have a <code>range</code> column from an older release of
Marginalia, you will need to convert its data now - otherwise Marginalia may 
simply delete the column.  This means populating the <code>start_</code> and
<code>end_</code> <code>block</code>, <code>word</code>, and <code>char</code>
fields appropriately (Marginalia should then be able to update 
<code>xpath</code> and <code>line</code> automatically when you view your
annotations).  The old formats are one of "/block/block word.char word.char" or 
"word.char word.char", so the update is simple but I simply haven't implemented
code to do it yet.  If this is you (I'm not sure it really applies to anyone
anymore), please contact me.</p>


<h2>Installation Problems</h2>

<p>If you have problems (common symptoms are that you can create annotations 
but they disappear when you reload the page, or you can only create one 
annotation - subsequent attempts fail), it is probably because of a 
misconfiguration.  First, make sure that the URL through which you are accessing
Moodle matches the one in <code>config.php</code>.  If you are using a different 
url (e.g. <kbd>localhost</kbd> instead of a numerical IP address), annotation 
will not work.</p>

<p>If your URL matches your configuration, I recommend installing and running 
the Firebug extension for Firefox.  Among other things, it tracks AJAX requests 
from a web page to the server.  The first thing to look for (other than any 
explicit errors reported by Firebug) is the URL of the GET request sent to 
annotation/annotate.php with the parameter "format=atom" when a page with 
annotations is first loaded.  Looking at the server response often immediately 
reveals the problem (assuming PHP error reporting is on).</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p>There are no significant known issues with this release.  If you find something,
please let me know.</p>


<h2>Uninstalling Annotation</h2>

<p>There is currently no automatic mechanism for uninstalling Marginalia, though it
is certainly possible to do so by replacing the patched files with the <kbd>.orig</kbd>
versions and deleting added files.  Some previous releases did have an uninstall 
script, but I don't want to release it again unless it is guaranteed to be safe 
for changed versions of Marginalia.</p>
