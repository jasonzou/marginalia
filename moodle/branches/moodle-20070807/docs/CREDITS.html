<h1>Marginalia Credits</h1>

<p>I (Geof Glass) wrote nearly all of the code for this project.  I want to particularly
thank BC Campus, Simon Fraser University, and SFU's Applied Communication Technologies
Group and e-Learning Innovation Centre of the Learning Instructional Development Centre
for their financial support.  Malaspina University-College has also been supportive,
as they provided a test site for Marginalia for Moodle.  In addition, the following people
have provided moral and technical support.  Without these people and organizations this
software would not exist.</p>

<li>Brent Lee</li>
<li>Trevor Bradley</li>
<li>Tom Lodge</li>
<li>Peter Reitsma</li>
