<h1>Using Annotations</h1>

<p>The annotation feature allows you to highlight passages of text and
add margin notes to discussion forum posts.  The capability to create
and modify annotations is only available on Firefox and Internet
Explorer.</p>

<h2>Enabling Annotations</h2>

<p>A drop-down list at the top of the page allows you to hide annotations,
or to show them for a specific user.  Only users with annotations on this
page are listed.  If you wish to write your own annotatons, select
<kbd>My Annotations</kbd> from the list.</p>

<p>Each annotation consists of a passage in the text (highlighted in
yellow) and an associated note in the right margin.  If there are many
annotations, or if highlighted passages overlap, it may be difficult 
to determine which note corresponds to which passage of text.  To find 
out, hover the mouse over either one and both will light up red.</p>

<h2>Create an Annotation</h2>

<p>Select a range of text in the content of a post.  Then type 
<kbd>Enter</kbd> or click the tall narrow button in the right margin 
(it is faintly outlined, but in Firefox lights up when the mouse pointer is
over it).  An edit box appears in the right margin.  Type in any margin 
note, then click elsewhere on the page or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to 
finish editing and save the annotation.</p>

<h2>Edit an Annotation</h2>

<p>Click on the annotation note in the right margin.
When you're finished editing, click elswhere or type <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>

<h2>Delete an Annotation</h2>

<p>Click the small <kbd>x</kbd> next to the note text in the right margin.</p>

<h2>Make an Annotation Private</h2>

<p>By default, annotations are public - that is, they can be seen by other
users (in theory, others non-users could also view your public notes).  This 
is indicated by a small circle in the margin next to the <kbd>x</kbd> delete 
button in the margin. that deletes the annotation.  This means
that anyone can view your annotation.  To make the annotation private, so that
only you can view it, click the circle.  It will be replaced with a filled
diamond, indicating that the annotation is private.  Click again if you wish
to make the annotation public.</p>

<h2>Viewing a Summary of Annotations</h2>

<p>It is possible to view a summary of annotations for one or more forum
discussions.  This list can include annotations by others, and is searchable
by keyword.  To access it, click the <kbd>summary</kbd> link in the right
margin of a post.</p>

<h2>Missing Annotations</h2>

<p>Under rare circumstances (e.g. if someone edits an existing post), the
annotation software may be unable to locate the text you highlighted when you
created the annotation.  In this case, the margin note is still shown, but
the highlighted passage is not.  In Firefox, a red exclamation mark next to 
the note indicates the problem;  hovering the mouse over it displays the
text of the original highlighted passage.  Problem annotations like this are
also displayed on th summary page.</p>

<p>Note that annotations cannot be deleted by anyone but you.  Even if an
annotated post or discussion is deleted, the annotations will still be
available through the summary page.</p>
