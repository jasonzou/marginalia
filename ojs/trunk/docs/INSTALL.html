<h1>Marginalia for OJS Installation</h1>

<p>The installation requires the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>PHP 4.3 or later</li>
	<li>OJS as of mid-September 2006 (a small fix was implemented to one of the
	page templates at this point)</li>
	<li>MySQL 4.1 or later (though a colleague has had success with MySQL 3; 
	I haven't tested with earlier versions or with Postgres)</li>
</ul>

<p>The install procedure doesn't change any existing files or database data,
but if you're paranoid like me, you might want to back up your OJS installation
before performing the install just to be sure.</p>

<p>Marginalia for OJS is a plugin.  Installing it is fairly straightforward.
First, copy the contents of the <kbd>ojs</kbd> directory in the installation
into your OJS directory.  Then you will need to log in to OJS as an administrator 
and switch on the plugin before it will work.  Note that only logged-in users 
can annotate articles in OJS.</p>

<p>Finally, you must create and populate the database tables required by Marginalia.  
The easiest way to do this is using OJS's built-in update procedure.  You must
enable the plugin first (as just described), or this step will not work.  From 
within your OJS install directory, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>php tools/upgrade.php upgrade</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can create the tables manually using the <kbd>tables.sql</kbd>
and <kbd>keywords.sql</kbd> scripts from the <kbd>util</kbd> directory of the 
Marginalia nistall.</p>

<p>That's all there is to it.  If you run into any difficulties, let me know.</p>

<h2>Installation Problems</h2>

<p>If you have problems, it is probably because of a misconfiguration.  First, make sure
that you always connect to OJS using the canonical URL (see config.inc.php in your
OJS installation);  otherwise annotations may not
always appear.  If you are using a different url (e.g. <kbd>localhost</kbd>
instead of a numerical IP address), annotation will not work.</p>

<p>If your URL matches your configuration, I recommend installing and running the Firebug
extension for Firefox.  Among other things, it tracks AJAX requests from a web page to
the server.  The first thing to look for (other than any explicit errors reported by
Firebug) is the URL of the GET request sent to annotation/annotate.php with the parameter
"format=atom" when a page with annotations is first loaded.  Trying loading this URL
on its own in a browser window:  it should return an Atom feed containing the annotations
for that page.</p>

<p>If there
is a problem connecting to the service, you will see an error.  A 404 error indicates
that Apache could not find the annotation service because of a misconfiguration.  One
possible cause is problems with mod_rewrite (see step 4 above).  Any
other error code usually means that the service is available, but something else is
wrong.  If there is a bug in the application, that could show up as an error code other 
than 404.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>This version has not yet been tested and tweaked for Internet Explorer.  It may
work - or it may not.  IE fixes should be forthcoming soon.  Note that Marginalia will
always run a little better on Firefox (e.g. there are user interface niceties on
Firefox that are absent on IE).</li>
<li>Annotation is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery.  I have not implemented
any defence because I believe a) the risk is vanishingly small and b) the consequences
of such an attack would be minor.  Basically, it is possible for a programmer to create 
a web page which - if you visited it while logged in to Moodle - could (in theory 
anyway) quietly create or delete your annotations.  Why anyone would want to do this
(it would take a bit of effert), I have no idea (this kind of attack is far more
dangerous for financial transactions online).  I'm just mentioning it in case you
feel differently.  If I am dreadfully wrong in my assessment, please drop me an email and
explain.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Uninstalling Annotation</h2>

<p>To uninstall annotation, simply delete the install directories:
<kbd>lib/marginalia</kbd> and <kbd>plugins/generic/MarginaliaPlugin</kbd>.  You
should also drop the database tables:  <kbd>annotations</kbd>, <kbd>preferences</kbd>,
and <kbd>keywords</kbd>.</p>
