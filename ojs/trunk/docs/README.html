<h1>Marginalia for OJS Readme</h1>

<p>This release of Marginalia is for Open Journal Systems.  It allows users to 
add margin notes to journal articles.  For updates to this release
and for a stand-alone demo version of the code, please see 
<a href="http://www.geof.net/code/annotation">my web site</a>.  Developers should see
the Subversion repository for test scripts, utilities, etc.</p>

<p>Please read <a href="INSTALL.html">INSTALL.html</a> to get started, and 
<a href="CREDITS.html">CREDITS.html</a> for information about
the organizations and individuals who have funded, supported, and helped with this

<h2>Limitations and Known Bugs</h2>

<p>I am aware of several limitations with the software:</p>

<ul>
<li>This version has only been tested with Firefox.  IE support is likely broken
for the moment.  Other browsers may work if and when they support relevant
web standards.</li>
<li>I have only tried annotation with a MySQL database.  It's possible there
are incompatibilities with others (e.g. Postgres).</li>
<li>Marginalia is incompatible with the Firefox "Auto Copy" extension if the
extension is set to automatically clear the selection once it has been copied
(this can be modified with the "Auto Copy" preferences).</li>
<li>Marginalia does not protect against a certain class of cross-site scripting
attack.  If an attacker could persuade a logged-in user of the system to visit
a web page, the attacker could try to furtively delete or create annotations 
belonging to that user.  I do not consider this a bug (if the site let the user
know what it would do, it could be useful) or a serious threat, and
have no intention to address it.  To my knowledge, the code is not vulnerable to
other more dangerous forms of cross-site scripting (input is filtered for 
dangerous characters, URLs, etc.).</li>
</ul>
