	Marginalia Demo by Geof Glass, www.geof.net/code/annotation
	The comments in this file are here to illustrate how to add annotation to a page.  I
	have included comments about Moodle also, as this is a clearer example than the actual
	Moodle code (which includes all the features of Moodle forums, not just annotations).
	This looks complicated with the comments.  Scroll to the second entry below (id="m2")
	to see how simple this stuff really is in practice.
	-->
	<title>Annotation Example</title>
	<!-- This stylesheet includes styling for the annotation margin.  The code makes heavy
	uses of CSS, so a stylesheet provides extensive controls over the look and feel of
	the interface (e.g. add graphics or icons, change the look and position of the delete
	button, number the annotation notes in the margin). -->
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="index.css"/>
	<!-- These all need to be included.  The order
	for inclusion matters for some of them. -->

	<!--
	The myCreateAnnotation function is essential because it must stop propagation of
	the button click that creates the annotation.  Otherwise, that click would be
	interpreted as a click outside the text edit for the annotation, in which case
	the annotation would be saved immediately without editing.  Note that this does
	*not* need to be called called when an annotation is created by typing Enter.
	
	The _skipContent callback must be defined for Marginalia to function (Marginalia
	callback function names begin with underscores).  It needs to be able to test an 
	HTML element to find out whether or not that node's contents should be included 
	when counting words and so on.  The _skipAnnotationLinks test should always be 
	performed if you're allowing annotations to include links;  _skipSmartcopy is 
	needed if Smartcopy is on.  If there are other reasons for other stuff in the
	content area (if, for example, you had actual annotation notes there), they 
	should be skipped too.
	
	marginaliaInit takes four parameters:
	1. The base URL of the application.  The annotation directory should be beneath 
	   this (where exactly depends on how you've set up your service calls in 
	   rest-annotate.js;  since this demo uses static-annotate.js instead it doesn't
	   really apply).  In the case of Moodle, this is the URL of the Moodle directory. 
	2. The name of the current user.  In Moodle this is the "username" field.
	3. The name of the user whose annotations are to be shown.
	4. The portion of the URL to strip.  If null, the database will store absolute URLs.
	   Otherwise, this can be the URL preceding the path (e.g. http://my.host.name), in
	   which case that portion of the URL is not stored (very useful if the host name
	   might change - otherwise, moving to a new server would require a search and replace
	   on annotated URLs in the database).  This should be more flexible and allow more 
	   of the path to be stripped;  for now those are the two choices.
	   
	The preferences object is required for load and storing user preferences, such as
	whether the user last created an annotation using a keywords drop-down or a text
	entry field.  The current implementation is a static dummy.
	  
	Keywords initialization is needed for the keywords drop-down.  It is called now to
	fetch the list of keywords so they will be ready when needed.
	  
	If you don't call smartcopyInit() and smartCopyOn(), smartcopy will not be enabled.

<!-- showAllAnnotations must be called to display all annotations on the page.  They can be 
hidden again with a call to hideAllAnnotations.  You may want to create a button or other
control to do this (as in Moodle).  The URL here is the URL of this page, although this 
depends on the back-end implementation. In Moodle, it is the URL of the forum page (or
whatever).  Here, the * is a wildcard.  The wildcarding convention and support are up to 
the back-end implementation;  most applications with only one region of content per web page 
probably have no use for it.  The wildcard matches against the URL for each entry (look for
the entrylink class). -->

				<p id='test1'>This is a demonstration of <a href="http://www.geof.net/code/annotation/">Marginalia</a>, my web

				note in the margin to associate with it.  The complete version saves your annotations,
				but for this demo I have not connected up a database:  if you reload this page,
				your changes will disappear.</p>
				
				<p>This version of Marginalia only works in Firefox, as I have not yet updated
				Internet Explorer support.  Other browsers may
				display the annotations, but as far as I know you cannot create them with
				other browsers (this may change as W3C standards are more widely adopted).
				Note that previous versions of this demo would cause IE to crash;  this has long
				been fixed, nonetheless use of this page is <a href="../LICENSE.txt">at your own risk</a>.</p>
				
				<p>In addition to annotation, Firefox users will be able to try smart copy.
				Select some text, then copy it somewhere (e.g. into an email message, a word
				processor document, or the text box at the bottom of this page).  The copied
				text will be prefixed by information about the source of the copy.  This is
				intended as a feature for discussion forums, so that users can more easily refer
				to other messages when they quote them.</p>

				In Moodle, this is nothing like the URL passed to showAllAnnotations;  the 
				necessary logic to connect the two is in the AnnotationSummaryQuery class in 
				lib.php.  This stand-alone implementation is simpler.  Note that this URL 
				should always be complete, starting with the protocol (http://), so that users
				can follow the link to find the annotated resource (e.g. by clicking on a link
				in a summary list of annotations, or in the Atom feed emitted by the server).
				For security reasons, only http and https protocols are permitted.  The 
				fragment identifier (#m1) is used here because there is more than one 
				annotatable region on this page (also the case in Moodle). -->

				<h4>Smart Copy</h4>
				
				<p>Smart copy is a hack which allows copy-paste operations to include additional
				context information, such as the title, author, and date of the post from which
				the copy was made.  Here's what you can try:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Select some text in the body of one of the messages above by
					clicking and dragging with the mouse.  The selection 
					must begin and end within the message body.</li>
					
					<li>Copy the selected text as you normally would (e.g. with <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd>
					or the <kbd>Copy</kbd> option in your browser's <kbd>Edit</kbd> menu).</li>
					
					<li>Paste the text into the text area below.  If you're
					using Firefox, you will see the additional context information.</li>
					
					<li>Now try copying into a word processor or new email message.  This time,
					the title of the source post will be a link.</li>
					
					<li>Finally, there's a bug:  try copying italicized text, such as the word
					"faculty" in the second mesasge.  The context information will also be
					italicized.  Sorry, I did say it was a hack.</li>
