= Repository Structure =

Marginalia consists of several sub-projects for Moodle, OJS, the demo, and so on.  Each project has its own code and also makes use of shared Marginalia code.  For example, to run the demo you will need to fetch `demo`, `marginalia-lib`, and `marginalia-php`.  The INSTALL.html file in the demo contains specific instructions.  See the Browse link under the tabs above to view the sub-projects in the repository.
