#Release Notes

= Upcoming Release =

This release is aimed at stabilizing and refining the Moodle version, though consideration is being given to the other versions also.  The following changes apply to the Marginalia core libraries:

  * IE (version 7) is again supported.  Safari is also now fully supported (thanks to browser improvements by Apple).

  * I found a serious problem that could cause margin notes to be wrongly ordered on pages containing HTML br elements.  Typically, notes would cluster towards the bottom of the margin, not near their highlights.  The fix requires a change in the database.  Fixes to data can only happen when a user logs in and views his or her annotations.  Pages displaying annotations by multiple users may exhibit this kind of incorrect behavior (even when they didn't before) until all users have viewed their annotations on the page.  This will fix annotations already experiencing the problem _so long as you visit the page in a non-IE browser_ (this is due to IE's lack of XPath support).

  * Marginalia previously assumed well-formed HTML, i.e. HTML in which block elements are never nested within inline elements.  Marginalia no longer makes this assumption, although in some cases it might be quite slow on malformed pages.

The following changes are Moodle-specific:

  * Smartcopy is gone.  It was a Firefox-specific hack that was not discoverable and seemed to seldom be used.  Instead, we now have Smartquotes.  A "quote" button beneath each forum message allows you to select and quote message content into a reply.  This will start a reply if necessary, or paste into a reply in another window.

  * Annotations can also be quoted.  If you wish to reply to someone else's annotation, click the quote button.  Or, you can effectively turn one of your own annotations into a forum post.  We found that users tried to conduct discussions within the annotation margin.  This is intended to redirect discussion back to the medium best suited for it - the forum itself.

  * Tags (keywords) have been replaced with a system to make it easy to type frequently used margin notes.  If a note has been used more than once, Marginalia can autocomplete it when you start typing.  This eliminates the +/- control next to each annotation, and eliminates the need to create tags on the Tags page.

  * The summary page search interface has been simplified.  The drop-down menus for specifying search criteria are gone.  Instead, you can click a pop-up icon next to the name of a user in the summary results in order to filter by that user.  You can do the same for tags (notes used more than once).  In order to remove filters from the search, click on links in the text description of the search at the top of the page.  Clicking here can also specify that the search should find exact matches of the search string (useful for keywords).

  * All users' existing (public) annotations on a forum page can be fixed automatically when an administrator views them.  This can prevent the display problem mentioned above.  This feature allows admin users to make changes to highlight range locations for other users, so it can be switched off for increased security.

  * The Moodle-specific code is being shifted towards Moodle's coding standards.
